# Cypher_Program
Was learning and messing around with JavaFX to create a program. Also note the code is an absolute mess because I was mainly testing. (Removed the old codebase, still a mess)

Usage for Transposition:

1) Provide Input Paramaters: (Cypher Text, Pad Key, Key)
2) Click "Go"
3) Click the generated Labels in either the Encryption or Decryption Path.
4) Encryption Label or Decryption Label contains what you need. (Encrypted Label means Encrypted with Path; Decrypted means Decrypted with path)

You can click the labels to copy the text.
